This is my personal Senior Independent Thesis. In this repository, a 3D Go-moku game is developed using Unity in C#. The game has three modes: human vs. computer, computer vs. computer and human vs. human. For the computer player, four AI strategies are implemented: the Greedy, the Minimax, the Neural Network and the random strategies. The human player can select different mode and different AI to play against.
